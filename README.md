# AI Paper Studio

## 📘 Project Overview
**AI Paper Studio** is a research writing assistant designed to help graduate students and academic professionals generate full-length paper sections with real APA-style references — all in one click.

## 🎯 Purpose
Many students struggle with the early stages of thesis writing — stuck between uncertainty, lack of structure, and referencing issues. This project aims to:
- Simplify the writing process by breaking it down into structured chapters.
- Use GPT-based AI to generate paragraph drafts for each standard section (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review).
- Provide real citations in APA format, sourced from verified academic databases.

## 🔁 User Flow
1. User enters a thesis topic
2. Selects which section to generate (e.g., Abstract, Methodology)
3. GPT-based engine generates a focused, on-topic paragraph
4. APA-style references are generated and attached
5. The user can copy and paste the result into their thesis

## 🛠️ What I want Devin to help with
I want to expand this Bubble-based prototype into a scalable React-based web app with:
- Section selection interface
- GPT integration with controllable prompt logic
- APA citation API integration (e.g., CrossRef, Semantic Scholar)
- Login and user document history features
- Basic freemium access control (e.g., daily usage limit)

## ✅ Progress So Far
- Completed low-code prototype in Bubble
- Prompt modules for 7 major academic sections
- Deployed and tested by actual students
- Two GitHub repositories created for development: `ai-paper-studio` and `talk-to-heart-ai`

## 🔭 Vision
This project can eventually scale into:
- A SaaS product for academic institutions
- A writing plugin for Notion or Google Docs
- A standalone assistant for thesis advisors and university workshops
